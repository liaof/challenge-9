## Description <a name="a"></a>

This week I have created a script utlising Node.js that automatically generates a markdown README upon answering the script's queries.
In the readme, necessary documentation such as installation instructions, usage guides, and more are generated based on user input. 
These components are then neatly indexed by a table of contents that links to each section. This table of contents can vary in size, based 
on whether the user has indicated the usage of any licenses. If yes, a link is created in the table of contents, as well as a 
corresponding text section and badges.


## Usage Guide <a name="b"></a>

Simply run the program from your command line and answer the questions prompted to you. You may use the /br line break to create lists and paragraphs,
which is recommended for some sections.
